serpentine and black marble.the huge windlass stood ready to raise a masterpiece of alexandrian art.
this was intended for the pediment, and represented vernus victrix with helmet, shield, and lance, leading
a band of winged gods of love, littles archers at whose head eros himself was discharging arrows, and
victoriously fighting against the three headed cerberus, death, already bleeding from many wounds.
there was no time to see the interior of the building, for pyrrhus expected his guest to join him at the
harbour at sunrise, and the eastern sky was already brightening with the approach of dawn. as the
friends reached the landing place the brass dome of the serapeum, which towered above everything, was
glittering with dazzling splendour. the pennons and masts of the fleet which was about to set sail from
the harbour seemed steeped in a sea of golden light. tremulous reflections of the brazen and gilded
figures on the prows of the vessels were mirrored in the undulating surface of the sea, and the long
shadows of the banks of oars united galley after galley on the surface of the water like meshes of
assurance. so they had parted, and the agitation of this fateful moment was still visible in the features
of the woman who had formerly sacrificed to her royal playfellow her love, and now offered her life.
when, ere leaving gorgiass house, she bade her friend farewell, she pressed dions hand with affectionate
warmth, and, as he accompanied her to the carriage, she informed him that, before the first encounter
